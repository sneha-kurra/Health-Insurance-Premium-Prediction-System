# Health Insurance Premium Prediction System

This project aims to predict health insurance premiums based on individual user details such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, sex, and region. It uses multiple machine learning models to analyze patterns and make accurate cost predictions, helping users and insurers estimate medical expenses.

## Features

- Predicts health insurance premiums using personal attributes.
- Data pre-processing with handling of missing values.
- One-hot encoding of categorical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Multiple machine learning models implemented:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Performance evaluation using R² Score, MAE, and MSE.
- Real-time input and prediction functionality.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas – Data manipulation
- NumPy – Numerical operations
- Scikit-learn – ML models and metrics
- Matplotlib – Data visualization
- Seaborn – Statistical visualizations

## Dataset

The dataset used is based on publicly available medical insurance data, with fields:
- `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `region`, `charges`

Sample data includes various age groups, BMI levels, smoking status, etc., to ensure robust model training.
